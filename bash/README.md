# SmartAccountWrapper Deployment Runbook

This directory contains thin bash wrappers around the Foundry deployment scripts.

> Current status: the epoch-staged implementation is deployed and smoke-tested on Ethereum mainnet. See [`deployments/`](../deployments/README.md) for the canonical addresses and verification evidence. Historical addresses from earlier implementations must not be reused as references for this code.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Default behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `predict.sh` | Dry-run `DeployAll` and preview deployed addresses | read-only |
| `deploy.sh` | Deploy implementation, beacon, and wrapper proxy | dry-run unless `--broadcast` is passed |
| `upgrade.sh` | Deploy a new implementation and upgrade an existing beacon | dry-run unless `--broadcast` is passed |
| `verify.sh` | Submit implementation, beacon, proxy, `Staging`, or coordinator block-explorer verification | submits verification request |

## Configuration

From the repository root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

Required deployment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CAST_WALLET_ACCOUNT` | Foundry/cast encrypted wallet account name, e.g. `deployer`. |
| `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` | Public address of the deployer account. |
| `BEACON_OWNER_WALLET_ACCOUNT` | Foundry/cast encrypted wallet account that owns the beacon and signs upgrades. |
| `BEACON_OWNER` | Public address of the beacon owner/admin. |
| `DEPLOY_SALT` | bytes32 CREATE3 salt for implementation/beacon/wrapper addresses. |
| `OWNER` | Owner/admin for the beacon and wrapper. Usually a Safe. |
| `SMART_ACCOUNT` | Smart account/Safe authorized to close and settle epochs. |
| `UNDERLYING_TOKEN` | ERC-20 asset used by this wrapper. |
| `VAULT_NAME` | ERC-20 name for wrapper shares. |
| `VAULT_SYMBOL` | ERC-20 symbol for wrapper shares. |
| `RPC_URL` | RPC endpoint used by deployment, preview, and upgrade scripts. |

Optional post-deployment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `BEACON_ADDRESS` | Existing beacon to upgrade or verify. |
| `WRAPPER_ADDRESS` | Existing wrapper proxy to record/verify. |
| `NETWORK` | Block explorer chain name used by `forge verify-contract --chain`, e.g. `mainnet` or `sepolia`. |
| `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | Block explorer API key used by `forge verify-contract`. |
| `VERIFIER_URL` | Optional Etherscan-compatible API URL override. `verify.sh` selects Etherscan V2 automatically for Arc chain ID `5042`. |


Create the deployer account in Foundry's encrypted keystore instead of writing a plaintext private key to `.env`:

```bash
cast wallet import deployer --interactive
```

Set `CAST_WALLET_ACCOUNT=deployer` and `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=0x...` in `.env`. For upgrades, also set `BEACON_OWNER_WALLET_ACCOUNT=beacon-owner` and `BEACON_OWNER=0x...` for the beacon owner/admin. Foundry will prompt for the keystore password when `--broadcast` is used. For local Anvil-only testing, set `ANVIL_UNLOCKED=true` and the relevant sender address to one of Anvil's unlocked accounts instead of using a cast wallet account.

## Preview deployment addresses

```bash
./bash/predict.sh
```

This runs the real `DeployAll` script in dry-run mode and does not send transactions.

## Deploy

Always dry-run first:

```bash
./bash/deploy.sh
```

If the dry-run output and deployment addresses are correct, broadcast explicitly:

```bash
./bash/deploy.sh --broadcast
```

The broadcast contains one top-level CREATE2 transaction for the one-shot `AtomicDeployment` coordinator. Its
constructor completes the implementation, beacon, wrapper, and `Staging` deployment before that transaction returns.

Use `--yes` only in automation after another process has validated the parameters:

```bash
./bash/deploy.sh --broadcast --yes
```

After a successful broadcast, record the emitted addresses in `.env`:

```bash
BEACON_ADDRESS=0x...
WRAPPER_ADDRESS=0x...
```

Then verify:

```bash
./bash/verify.sh implementation 0x...
./bash/verify.sh beacon 0x... 0x... # beacon address, then implementation address
./bash/verify.sh wrapper 0x... 0x... # wrapper address, then beacon address
./bash/verify.sh staging 0x... 0x... # staging address, then wrapper address
./bash/verify.sh coordinator 0x...
```

The script reconstructs each constructor payload from the third argument and the original deployment values in `.env`. The beacon needs its original implementation address; the proxy needs its beacon address; `Staging` needs the wrapper address; and the coordinator needs the original deployment tuple. The wrapper initializer deploys `Staging`, so read its address from `wrapper.staging()` before verifying it.

Arc mainnet uses Etherscan API V2 at `https://api.etherscan.io/v2/api?chainid=5042`. The repository keeps that custom-chain mapping in `foundry.toml` because older Foundry releases do not know Arc's Etherscan URL. Source verification publishes no transaction and needs no wallet or gas.

After verification, add a permanent record under `deployments/<chain-id>/<wrapper-address>/` containing the full source commit, compiler settings, all deployment transaction receipts, every deployed address, initialization values, live runtime-bytecode hashes, proxy-slot checks, explorer links, and a pinned-block verification report. Do not commit RPC URLs, API keys, keystore names, signer details, or mutable `run-latest.json` broadcast aliases.

## Upgrade

Dry-run first:

```bash
./bash/upgrade.sh
```

Broadcast only after reviewing the target beacon and signer:

```bash
./bash/upgrade.sh --broadcast
```

The upgrade script deploys a fresh `SmartAccountWrapper` implementation and calls `UpgradeableBeacon.upgradeTo(newImplementation)`. It does **not** reinitialize existing proxies.

## Request deposits and redeems

The Foundry request helpers broadcast as the asset/share owner rather than the deployer:

```bash
export REQUEST_OWNER=0x...
export REQUEST_OWNER_WALLET_ACCOUNT=request-owner
REQUEST_ASSETS=1000000000000000000 forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:RequestDeposit --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --sender "$REQUEST_OWNER" --account "$REQUEST_OWNER_WALLET_ACCOUNT"
REQUEST_SHARES=1000000000000000000 forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:RequestRedeem --rpc-url "$RPC_URL" --sender "$REQUEST_OWNER" --account "$REQUEST_OWNER_WALLET_ACCOUNT"
```

Set `REQUEST_CONTROLLER=0x...` only when the ERC-7540 controller should differ from `REQUEST_OWNER`; in that case make sure the signer is authorized for the owner/controller path and that token/share allowances are already in place.

## Safety checklist before broadcasting

- Confirm the selected `RPC_URL` and verification `NETWORK`.
- Confirm the cast wallet account or Anvil unlocked sender is authorized for the action: `DEPLOYER_ADDRESS` for deployment, `BEACON_OWNER` for upgrades, or `REQUEST_OWNER` for request helpers.
- Confirm `OWNER`, `SMART_ACCOUNT`, `UNDERLYING_TOKEN`, `VAULT_NAME`, and `VAULT_SYMBOL`.
- Confirm dry-run deployment addresses are new/expected.
- For upgrades, confirm the beacon currently belongs to the intended deployment.
- Run `forge test` and `forge build --sizes` on the exact commit being deployed.
- Ensure the exact commit has received the required audit/security review.

## Notes

- CREATE3 addresses are deterministic for the same coordinator and salt. The coordinator address is deterministic for
  the same deployer, salt, deployment parameters, and compiled coordinator initcode; changing any of them changes the
  component addresses.
- The smart account/Safe is the only account allowed to close and settle epochs.
- Do not use addresses from older deployments as evidence that the current contracts are deployed.
